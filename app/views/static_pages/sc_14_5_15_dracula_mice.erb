  Anti-aging stories are the best. They give me hope that all the terrible terrible things I do to my body today might be reversible in the future. Or that I can continue doing terrible things well into my 80's. Regardless, I like today's topic because it seems so medieval. Want to be healthy? Forget the medicine; all you need is blood of the young. To be more precise, young blood contains factors that may have an anti-aging effect on older individuals. Three studies, two <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6184/649.abstract">from</a> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6184/630.abstract
  ">Harvard</a> and one from <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.3569.html">Stanford</a>, found that older mice performed close to their younger counterparts both physically and mentally when infused with blood from their younger counterparts. If these results could be replicated in humans, we could see a reversal in muscle and mental atrophy with a simple protein supplement - shit's crazy.

  One of the earliest experiments to show the rejuvenating qualities of young blood involved a nasty experimental technique called parabiosis. Pairs of mice, one 2-years-old (ancient) and one 2-months-old, were surgically linked to share a circulatory system. Besides giving the experiment a rather macabre and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">Shelley-esque</a> feel, the results were astonishing. Before the treatment, the old mice had thick and stiffened hearts. Although thickened cardiac tissue can pump blood, it can’t relax enough between beats to refill completely – a condition called diastolic heart failure, something for which there is no human treatment. After just 4 weeks of parabiosis, the hearts of the older mice thinned and softened; the old mice had young hearts. The researchers later published a <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(13)00456-X">paper</a> narrowing down one of the responsible proteins to the GDF11 growth factor (growth factor is just a fancy term for a protein/hormone that typically turns on some pathways to stimulate cellular growth).

  More recently, Wagner’s lab found that GDF11 also <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6184/649.abstract">improves muscle healing, endurance, and overall strength in older mice</a>. Harvard neuroscientist Lee Rubin’s lab found that GDF11 has a similar effect on mouse brains, encouraging new blood vessel and olfactory neuron growth (i.e. the old mice could smell better with young blood). In typical fashion, Harvard is currently attempting to patent the naturally occuring GDF11. But the effects aren't limited to the single growth factor; researchers at Stanford and UCSF found that injecting blood plasma from young to old mice <a href="http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.3569.html">improved connections between hippocampal neurons</a>, which are responsible for memory. If these effects carry over to humans, we could see a wonder drug for cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's, and general shittiness that comes from old-age. All we need is the blood of our young.
